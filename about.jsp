<body>
   <p><i>Lucas was first started by MS.Chenchu Lakshmi V as a little engineering books store in online . 
   It is further developed into a all books online sales as a result of huge success and recommendations for story books and novels.
   Then we started taking orders for home delivery and started delivering our books to all the schools . This developed our business 
   to establish all kinds of book requests. We started selling all language books worldwide. We thought this will
   help people buy books sitting in their home. "books increase our knowledge" this helps us do our business
